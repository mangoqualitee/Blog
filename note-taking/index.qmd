I wished when I was in 5th grade that all the heavy books in my bag would vanish. I wished when I was in 2nd year of College that all of my pdfs would become a physical book. I lost energy, time in this conflict till I had no thoughts on this. Momentarilly I am flowing with the digital.

I want [three-column] note-taking method. First column: Live Lecture Notes. Second column: Pre (or Post) Lecture Review Notes, and Live Remarks. Third column: Actionable Tasks, Live (or Review) Questions.

Something similar to above: I want Logging with todos, I want un-polished Notes, and then I want insights and implications in a [resource].

I need to be able to quickly give a minute-to-minute log of what I was doing throughout the day, week, month. Like org-mode-agenda. I had a two format (long log, groupby time log) excel sheet for this once.

Like the multi-timer app.
